# 2D Pong Game

This is a basic 2D Pong game developed for the COMP-2800 course at the university. It's a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Java and the Gradle build system. The game can be played on any machine with Java and Gradle installed.

## Getting Started

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
sudo apt install gradle
```

#### Windows

- **Java Installation**
  1. Download the JDK installer from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
  2. Run the installer and follow the instructions.
  3. Add JDK's `bin` folder to the system's `Path` variable (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11\bin`).

- **Gradle Installation**
  1. Download the latest Gradle distribution from [Gradle Releases](https://gradle.org/releases/).
  2. Extract the ZIP to a directory, e.g., `C:\Gradle`.
  3. Add Gradle's `bin` directory to the system's `Path` variable (`C:\Gradle\gradle-7.0\bin`).
